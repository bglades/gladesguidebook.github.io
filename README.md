About this project:
This is a project I am working on while enrolled in MIT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding. My intention with this project is to develop this page with new information I am learning. This is essentially practice. However, the project is about some of my favorite topics like rock climbing, hiking, and travelling. Eventually I hope to have a beautifully designed interactive webpage.
