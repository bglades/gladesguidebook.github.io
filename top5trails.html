            <h3>1. Cupid and Grizzly Peak</h3>
            <p><strong>Trailhead</strong>: Loveland Pass Summit<br>                <strong>Parking</strong>: Park at Loveland Pass Summit<br>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 6.7mi<br>
            <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,631ft<br>
            <strong>Cupid Peak Summit:</strong> 13,117ft<br>
            <strong>Grizzly Peak Summit:</strong> 13,334ft<br> 
            <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard<br></p>
            <p>The trail begins on the east side of the road. There are trails on both sides of the road so be aware.<br>
                At the first summit the trail splits. Take the right fork. From here the trail leads to Cupid Peak. You will <br>easily see Grizzly Peak ahead of you. Grizzly Peak is a harder climb but worth it. You will have amazing<br> views of Grey's and Torrey's Peaks, Mt. Sniktau, and Summit County.  </p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="sniktau">
            <img src="Sniktau.jpg", width="50%",height="auto"/>
            <h3>2. Sniktau Mountain </h3>
            <p><strong>Trailhead:</strong> Loveland Pass Summit<br>
            <strong>Parking:</strong>Park at Loveland Pass Summit<br>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 4mi<br>
            <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,587ft<br>
            <strong>Summit:</strong> 13,240ft<br>
            <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderately Hard<br></p>
            The parking and trailhead are the same as above. At the fork you will go left instead. <br>This will take you directly to Sniktau Mountain. Be aware of the false summit! <br>You really only need about 3-4 hours to do this trail. It's a quick and rewarding peak.</p><br>

            <h3>3. Square Top Mountain</h3>
            <p><strong>Trailhead/Parking:</strong> There are two parking areas at the summit of Guanella Pass. The trail starts<br> at the parking lot on the west side of the road. It is often difficult to find<br> parking in the east lot as this lot is the trailhead to Mt. Bierstadt.<br>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 6.5mi<br>
            <strong> Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,400ft<br>
            <strong>Summit:</strong> 13,749ft<br>
            <strong>Difficutly:</strong> Hard</p><br>
            <p>This peak is harder than many of the Colorado 14ers. In fact, Mt. Bierstadt is just across<br> the street. Hundreds of people will be hiking Mt. Bierstadt but few will be <br>on Square Top Mountain. 
            You will get the same views without all the people. <br> Plus parking in the west lot is a bit smoother. Keep an eye out for signs and kairns.<br> The trail forks for Square Top Lakes. 
            This hike is worth doing <br>if you'd like an easier day. If you're headed for the summit, stay left at the fork<br> headed away from the lakes. The trail takes you to the southwest side<br> of the mountain for the upward trudge. 
            The final climb up is a scramble with<br> loose gravel. 
            Stay away from the north side as there are large cliffs.<br> Please be aware that there are multiple false summits. Keep going. It is worth the trudge. </p><br>

            <h3>4. Lake Isabelle</h3>
            <strong>Trailhead:</strong> Isabelle Glacier Trail #908. Southeast side of Brainard Lake.</p>
            <strong>Parking:</strong> Park at Brainard Lake. There is a fee to enter the Brainard Lake Recreation Area.</p>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 4.2mi</p>
            <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> about 500ft </p>
            <strong>Lake Elevation:</strong> ~10,900ft </p>
            <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate</p>
            <p>This hike starts near the Peak to Peak Highway. You'll have a beautiful drive<br> to Brainard Lake Recreation Area but you'll need to pay the fee to enter<br> the area. You are also able to park at the Gateway Trailhead<br> and hike to Brainard Lake. Sometimes there is no parking within the recreation area<br> and you'll have to do this.
            This will add <br>4 miles onto your round trip hike. You can easily <br>avoid this by showing up early(before 8am). 
            The trail starts on<br> the southest edge of the lake. There are signs and navigating<br> here is easy. The trail is also easy to follow.
            There are<br> no major forks to watch for. There are a few smaller lakes <br>before you make it to Isabelle Glacier. There are plenty<br> of moose in this area so keep an eye out. Once you make it to the<br> lake the trail continues to Isabelle Glacier.
            If you're looking for <br>a longer and more difficult day, consider hiking to the glacier. </p>

            <h3>5. St. Mary's Glacier to James Peak</h3>
            <p><strong>Trailhead:</strong> St.Mary's Trailhead<br>
            <strong>Parking:</strong> St. Mary's Trailhead. Parking is $5.<br>
            <strong> Distance:</strong> 8mi<br>
            <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 2,950ft<br>
            <strong>Summit:</strong> 13,294ft<br>
            <strong>Difficulty</strong> Hard<br>
            <p>Start out at the St. Mary's Trailhead. Hike to St. Mary's 
            Lake and make<br> your way to the Glacier just above the lake. 
            The trail <br>is obvious and there are signs. 
            Hike to the top of the glacier<br> and follow the trail to the top of the pass. 
            There are plenty<br> of forks but you'll want to keep going straight. 
            Don't take<br> any fork. Again, there are signs and kairns. <br>
            Making your way up James Peak is the hardest part. For an<br> easier day, turn around at
            St. Mary's Lake or Glacier. </p>
